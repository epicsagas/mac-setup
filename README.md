# dvL-den | macOS Setup that suit my needs

## Information
Please, do not use my setup as is. If you want to give it a try, I suggest you to fork my repo first, review the code, change it and tweak it to your needs. Don't just blindly run it, because it may not be something that you want/need.

## Warning
Some of these files require iCloud and specific data to be stored in them for auto-sync. Only sublime-text uses this feature at time being, but I may use it more often if I find appropriate usage for another app. Sublime's `User` folder is being synced (settings, preferences & snippets)

## Installation
`mkdir ~/.dot && curl -L "https://github.com/dvLden/macOS-Setup/tarball/master" | tar -xz -C ~/.dot --strip-components=1 && cd ~/.dot && sh bootstrap`
